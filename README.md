# Birthday Greetings

Taken [frm Coding Dojo](https://codingdojo.org/kata/birthday-greetings/)

As youâ€™re a very friendly person, you would like to send a birthday note to all the friends you have. But you have a lot of friends and a bit lazy, it may take some times to write all the notes by hand.

The good news is that computers can do it automatically for you.

Imagine you have a flat file with all your friends :
```
last_name, first_name, date_of_birth, email
Doe, John, 1982/10/08, john.doe@foobar.com
Ann, Mary, 1975/09/11, mary.ann@foobar.com
```

And you want to send them a happy birthday email on their birth date :

```
Subject: Happy birthday!

Happy birthday, dear <first_name>!
```

How would this software look like ? Try to implement it so you can easily change :

- the way you retrieve the friends data (for instance, try switching to a SQLite Db)
- the way you send the note : (for instance, imagine you want to send SMS instead of emails)

What kind of tests would you write ? Would you use Mocks ?
